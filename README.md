## ⚙️ Basic Principle of RF Energy Harvesting

RF energy harvesting systems typically consist of the following blocks:
RF Source → Antenna → Matching Network → Rectifier → DC Filter → Load / Storage



### 1️⃣ RF Source
- Ambient RF signals (Wi-Fi, GSM, LTE, TV broadcast, ISM bands)
- Frequency range: **MHz to GHz**

### 2️⃣ Antenna
- Captures electromagnetic waves
- Types: Dipole, Patch, Fractal, Monopole

### 3️⃣ Impedance Matching Network
- Maximizes power transfer
- Designed using LC networks or transmission lines

### 4️⃣ Rectifier (Rectenna Core)
- Converts RF (AC) to DC
- Common topologies:
  - CMOS rectifiers
  - Schottky diode rectifiers
  - Voltage multipliers (Dickson, Greinacher)

### 5️⃣ DC Filter & Energy Storage
- Smooths DC output
- Capacitor / Supercapacitor / Rechargeable battery
